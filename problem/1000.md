## 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones

There are N piles of stones arranged in a row.  The i-th pile has stones[i] stones.

A move consists of merging exactly K consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these K piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile.  If it is impossible, return -1.

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.
Example 2:

Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.
Example 3:

Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], K = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int mergeStones(vector<int>& stones, int K) {
        int n = stones.size();
        if((n - 1) % (K - 1))
            return -1;
        
        vector<int>prefix(n + 1);
        for(int i = 0 ; i < stones.size() ; i++)
            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + stones[i];
        
        vector<vector<int>>dp(n , vector<int>(n, 0));
        for(int m = K ; m <= n ; m++){
            for(int i = 0 ; i + m <= n ; i++){
                int j = m + i - 1;
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for(int mid = i ; mid < j ; mid += K-1){
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][mid] + dp[mid+1][j]);
                }
                if((j - i) % (K - 1) == 0)
                    dp[i][j] += prefix[j + 1] - prefix[i];
                
            }
        }
        // for(auto i : dp){
        //     for(auto j : i)
        //         cout << j << " ";
        //     cout << endl;
        // }
        
        return dp[0][n-1];
    }
};
