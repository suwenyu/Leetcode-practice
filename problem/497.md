## 497. Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

1. An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. 
2. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. 
3. ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
4. length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
5. 1 <= rects.length <= 100
6. pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
7. pick is called at most 10000 times.


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]


Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
    map<int, int>m;
    // vector<int>rects;
    vector<vector<int>>rects1;
    int sum = 0;
    
public:
    Solution(vector<vector<int>>& rects) {
        this->rects1 = rects;
        sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i < rects.size(); i++){
            sum += (rects[i][2]-rects[i][0]+1) * (rects[i][3]-rects[i][1]+1);
            m.insert(make_pair(sum, i));
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> pick() {
        map<int, int>::iterator it = m.upper_bound(rand() % (sum + 1));
        vector<int>res = rects1[it->second];
        int l = res[0], r = res[2], u = res[3], d = res[1];
        return {l + rand() % (r-l+1), d + rand() % (u-d+1)};
    }
};

/**

 * Solution* obj = new Solution(rects);
 * vector<int> param_1 = obj->pick();
 */
```


### Others Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> rect;
    vector<int> r_area;
    int total_area;
    Solution(vector<vector<int>> rects) {
        rect = rects;
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rects.size(); i++) {
            total += (rects[i][2] - rects[i][0]+1)*(rects[i][3] - rects[i][1]+1);
            r_area.push_back(total);
        }
        total_area = total;
    }
    
    vector<int> pick() {
        int random_area = rand()%total_area+1;
        int i = 0;
        for (; i < r_area.size(); i++) {
            if (random_area <= r_area[i]) break;
        }
        int dis_x = rand()%(rect[i][2] - rect[i][0]+1);
        int dis_y = rand()%(rect[i][3] - rect[i][1]+1);
        return {rect[i][0] + dis_x, rect[i][1] + dis_y};
    }
};
