## 1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced

You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
- It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.

You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.

### Example

Example 1

```text
Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".
```

Example 2

```text
Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][[]".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".
```

### Code

Method 1.
Priority Queue
Time O(N)
Space O(N)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        stack<char> stack;
        int mismatch = 0;
        
        for(auto c : s){
            if(c == '[')
                stack.push(c);
            else{
                if(!stack.empty())
                    stack.pop();
                else
                    mismatch++;
            }
        }
        
        
        
        return (mismatch+1)/2;
    }
};
```

Method 2.
Two pointers

Time: O(N)
Space: O(1)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        int left = 0, right = 0, N = s.size(), L = 0, R = N - 1, ans = 0; 
        while (L < R) {
            for (; L < R; ++L) {
                left += s[L] == '[' ? 1 : -1;
                if (left == -1) break;
            }
            if (L >= R) break; // no more unmatched branchets, break
            for (; L < R; --R) {
                right += s[R] == ']' ? 1 : -1;
                if (right == -1) break;
            }
            left = right = 1; // after swapping `s[L]` and `s[R]`, `left` and `right` will become `1`.
            ++L, --R;
            ++ans;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
