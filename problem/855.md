## 855. Exam Room

In an exam room, there are N seats in a single row, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.

When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person.  If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number.  (Also, if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.)

Return a class ExamRoom(int N) that exposes two functions: ExamRoom.seat() returning an int representing what seat the student sat in, and ExamRoom.leave(int p) representing that the student in seat number p now leaves the room.  It is guaranteed that any calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) have a student sitting in seat p.


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"], [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]
Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5]
Explanation:
ExamRoom(10) -> null
seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
leave(4) -> null
seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
```

### My Code
```c++
class ExamRoom {
    vector<int> L;
    int N;
public:
    ExamRoom(int n) {
        N = n;
    }
    
    int seat() {
        if(L.size() == 0){
            L.push_back(0);
            return 0;
        }
        
        int dis = max(L[0], N-1-L[L.size()-1]);
        
        for(int i = 0; i < L.size()-1; i++)
            dis = max(dis, (L[i+1]-L[i])/2);

        
        if(dis == L[0]){
            L.insert(L.begin(), 0);
            return 0;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0;i < L.size()-1; i++){
            if((L[i+1]-L[i])/2 == dis){
                L.insert(L.begin()+i+1, (L[i]+L[i+1])/2);
                return L[i+1];
            }
        }
        L.push_back(N-1);
        return N-1;
        
        
        
    }
    
    void leave(int p) {
        for(int i = 0 ; i < L.size() ; i++)
            if(L[i] == p)
                L.erase(L.begin()+i);
    }
};

/**
 * Your ExamRoom object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * ExamRoom* obj = new ExamRoom(N);
 * int param_1 = obj->seat();
 * obj->leave(p);
 */
```
Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(N)
用一個陣列存儲現在哪個位置有人坐，
計算長度的時候先比較 L[0]（表示第一個距離0的位置）與N - 1-L[n-1]表示最後一個距離最後位置的長度
然後在計算中間每個人彼此之間的長度/2 最後找到最長的 insert進去

### Others Solution
```c++
class ExamRoom {
    int N;
    list<int> seats;
    unordered_map<int, list<int>::iterator> hash_map;
public:
    ExamRoom(int N) {
        this->N = N;
    }
    
    int seat() {
        if (seats.empty())
            return seats.push_back(0), hash_map[0] = seats.begin(), 0;
        int last = -1, dist, val;
        list<int>::iterator pos;
        for (auto it = seats.begin(); it != seats.end(); ++it) {
            if (last == -1)
                dist = *it, pos = it, val = 0;
            else if ((*it - last) / 2 > dist)
                dist = (*it - last) / 2, pos = it, val = (*it + last) / 2;
            last = *it;
        }
        if (N - 1 - seats.back() > dist)
            pos = seats.end(), val = N - 1;
        return hash_map[val] = seats.insert(pos, val), val;
    }
    
    void leave(int p) {
        seats.erase(hash_map[p]);
    }
};
```
seat: Time complexity O(n)
leave: time complexity O(1)
