## 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing

We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.


### Example
```
Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwap(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        int swapRecord = 1, fixRecord = 0;
        for(int i = 1 ; i < A.size() ; i++){
            if(A[i-1] >= B[i] || B[i-1] >= A[i]){
                swapRecord++;
            }
            else if(A[i-1] >= A[i] || B[i-1] >= B[i]){
                int tmp = swapRecord;
                swapRecord = fixRecord + 1;
                fixRecord = tmp;
            }
            else {
                int min_val = min(swapRecord, fixRecord);
                swapRecord = min_val + 1;
                fixRecord = min_val;
            }
            cout << swapRecord << " " << fixRecord << endl;
        }   
        return min(swapRecord, fixRecord);
    }
};
```


### Others Solution
```c++
    int minSwap(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        int N = A.size();
        int not_swap[1000] = {0};
        int swap[1000] = {1};
        for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
            not_swap[i] = swap[i] = N;
            if (A[i - 1] < A[i] && B[i - 1] < B[i]) {
                not_swap[i] = not_swap[i - 1];
                swap[i] = swap[i - 1] + 1;
            }
            if (A[i - 1] < B[i] && B[i - 1] < A[i]) {
                not_swap[i] = min(not_swap[i], swap[i - 1]);
                swap[i] = min(swap[i], not_swap[i - 1] + 1);
            }
        }
        return min(swap[N - 1], not_swap[N - 1]);
    }
```
