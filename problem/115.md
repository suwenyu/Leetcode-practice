## 115. Distinct Subsequences

Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^


Example 2:

Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        int m = s.size(), n = t.size();
        vector<vector<long>>dp(n+1, vector<long>(m+1));
        for(int j = 0; j <= m ; j++)
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= n ; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= m ; j++){
                if(t[i-1] == s[j-1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-1];
                else
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][m];
    }
};
```
