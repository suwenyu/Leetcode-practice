## 980. Unique Paths III

On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:

* 1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
* 2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
* 0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
* -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.


### Example

Example 1
```
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
```

Example 2
```
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)
```

Example 3
```
Input: [[0,1],[2,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.
```


### Code
Method 1.

First find out where the start and the end is.
Also We need to know the number of empty cells.

We we try to explore a cell,
it will change 0 to -2 and do a dfs in 4 direction.

If we hit the target and pass all empty cells, increment the result.


Complexity
Time complexity is as good as dp,
but it take less space and easier to implement.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int empty = 1, ans = 0;
    
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y){
        if(x < 0 || x >= grid.size() || y < 0 || y >= grid[0].size() || grid[x][y] < 0)
            return;
        if(grid[x][y] == 2){
            if(empty == 0)
                ans++;
            return;
        }
        
        grid[x][y] = -2;
        empty--;
        dfs(grid, x + 1, y);
        dfs(grid, x - 1, y);
        dfs(grid, x, y + 1);
        dfs(grid, x, y - 1);
        grid[x][y] = 0;
        empty++;
        
    }
    
    int uniquePathsIII(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        int sx, sy;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < m ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < n ; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == 0)
                    empty++;
                else if(grid[i][j] == 1){
                    sx = i;
                    sy = j;
                }
            }
        }
        
        dfs(grid, sx, sy);
        return ans;
    }
};
```
