## 376. Wiggle Subsequence

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle sequence.

A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) are alternately positive and negative.
In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.


### Example
Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
```

Example 3
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

### Code
Method 1.
Greedy
Time Complexity: O(N)
Spcae Complexity: O(1)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n <= 1)
            return n;
        
        int up = 1, down = 1;
        for(int i = 1 ; i < n ; i++){
            if(nums[i] > nums[i-1])
                up = down+1;
            if(nums[i] < nums[i-1])
                down = up + 1;
            
        }
        return max(up, down);
    }
};
```


Method 2.
Dynamic Programming
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int size=nums.size();
        if(size==0) return 0;
        vector<int> f(size, 1);
        vector<int> d(size, 1);
        for(int i=1; i<size; ++i){
            for(int j=0; j<i; ++j){
                if(nums[j]<nums[i]){
                    f[i]=max(f[i], d[j]+1);
                }
                else if(nums[j]>nums[i]){
                    d[i]=max(d[i], f[j]+1);
                }
            }
        }
        return max(d.back(), f.back());
    }
};
```
