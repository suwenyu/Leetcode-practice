## 686. Repeated String Match

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").


### Example
```
Input: "abc","cabcabca"
Ouput: 4

Input: "abcd", "cdabcdab"
Output: 3

```

### My Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def repeatedStringMatch(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: str
        :type B: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        C = ""
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(B)/len(A)+3):
            if B in C:
                return count
            C += A
            count += 1
        return -1     
```


### Others Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def repeatedStringMatch(self, A, B):
        times = -(-len(B) // len(A)) # Equal to ceil(len(b) / len(a))
        for i in range(2):
          if B in (A * (times + i)):
            return times + i
        return -1

```
