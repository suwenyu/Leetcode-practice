## 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

### Example
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its depth = 3.
```

### My Code
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* head = root;
        if(root)
            return max(maxDepth(head->left), maxDepth(head->right))+1;
        return 0;
    }
};
```
