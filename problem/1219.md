## 1219. Path with Maximum Gold

In a gold mine grid of size m * n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

* Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
* From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.
* You can't visit the same cell more than once.
* Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
* You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28
Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    // const vector<vector<int>> dirs = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
    vector<int> directions={0,1,0,-1,0};
    
    int helper(vector<vector<int>>grid, int i, int j, int m, int n){        
        int res = 0, x, y, tmp = grid[i][j];
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        
        // for(auto d: dirs){
        //     x = i + d[0], y = j + d[1];
        //     if(x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n && grid[x][y] != 0){
        //         res = max(res, grid[x][y] + helper(grid, x, y, m, n));
        //     }
        // }
        for(int d=0;d<4;d++)                    //Try all 4 possible directions
        {
            x=i+directions[d],y=j+directions[d+1];
            if(x>=0&&y>=0&&x<grid.size()&&y<grid[x].size()&&grid[x][y]!=0)
                res=max(res,grid[x][y]+helper(grid,x,y, m, n));  //Set grid[i][j] to 0 to mark as visited before next dfs and reset the values after the dfs ends
        }
        grid[i][j] = tmp;
        return res;
    }
    
    int getMaximumGold(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        int ans = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < m ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < n ; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] > 0){
                    int gold = helper(grid, i, j, m, n);
                    ans = max(ans, gold + grid[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
