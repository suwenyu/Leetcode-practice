## 973. K Closest Points to Origin

We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

### Example
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

### My Code
```c++
struct Compare {
    bool operator()(pair<int, int> a, pair<int, int> b){
        return a.first > b.first;
    }
};

class Solution {
private:
    struct compare{
        bool operator()(vector<int>& p, vector<int>& q) {
            return p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1] > q[0] * q[0] + q[1] * q[1];
        }
    };
public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int K) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        
        priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, compare> pq(points.begin(), points.end());
        
        
        for(int i=0 ; i < K ; i++){
            ans.push_back(pq.top());
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
把points 放進去priority queue，然後寫個 compare function 給 pq，
記憶一下寫法
把前面K個存下來就解決了
