## 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

### Example:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

### Others Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        vector<int>v;
        
        int i=0, j=numbers.size()-1;
        while(j>i){
            if(numbers[i]+numbers[j] == target){
                cout << i << " " << j << endl;
                v.push_back(i+1);
                v.push_back(j+1);
                break;
            }
            else if(numbers[i]+numbers[j] > target){
                j--;
            }
            else{
                i++;
            }
            
        }
        
        return v;
    }
};
```
