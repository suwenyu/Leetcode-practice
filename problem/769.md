## 769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted

Given an array arr that is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1], we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.  After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.


Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr) {
        int maxCur = -1;
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=0; i < arr.size(); i++){
            maxCur = max(maxCur, arr[i]);
            if(maxCur == i)
                ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
只有當數字是一直升序的才可能可以chunk
因此只要max == 當前的變量index -> ans++

### Others Solution
```c++
```
