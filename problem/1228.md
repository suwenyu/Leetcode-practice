## 1228. Missing Number In Arithmetic Progression

In some array arr, the values were in arithmetic progression: the values arr[i+1] - arr[i] are all equal for every 0 <= i < arr.length - 1.

Then, a value from arr was removed that was not the first or last value in the array.

Return the removed value.

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: arr = [5,7,11,13]
Output: 9
Explanation: The previous array was [5,7,9,11,13].

Example 2:

Input: arr = [15,13,12]
Output: 14
Explanation: The previous array was [15,14,13,12].
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int tmp = (arr[n-1] - arr[0])/n;
        
        int i = 1;
        for( ; i < arr.size() ; i++){
            // cout << arr[i] << " " << arr[i-1] << endl;
            if((arr[i] - arr[i-1]) != tmp){
                break;
            }
        }
        return arr[i-1] + tmp;
    }
};
```


### Others Solution
```c++
int missingNumber(vector<int>& A) {
    int first = A[0], last = A[0], sum = 0, n = A.size();
    for (int a : A) {
        first = min(first, a);
        last = max(last, a);
        sum += a;
    }
    return (first + last) * (n + 1) / 2 - sum;
}
```

binary search
```c++
int missingNumber(vector<int>& A) {
        int n = A.size(), d = (A[n - 1] - A[0]) / n, left = 0, right = n;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (A[mid] == A[0] + d * mid)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid;
        }
        return A[0] + d * left;
    }
```
