## 1184. Distance Between Bus Stops

A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.

```
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.

```
Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    
    int distanceBetweenBusStops(vector<int>& distance, int start, int destination) {
        unordered_set<int>visited;
        
        int res1 = 0, res2 = 0;
        for(int i = start ; i != destination ; i = (i+1)%distance.size() )
            res1 += distance[i];
        
        for(int i = destination; i != start ; i = (i+1)%distance.size())
            res2 += distance[i];
        return min(res1, res2);
        
    }
};
```
