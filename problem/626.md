## 626. Exchange Seats

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

### Example
```
Input:
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+

Output:
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```
### Others Solution
```c++
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id,
case 
    when id%2 = 0 then (select student from seat where id = (i.id-1) )  
    when id%2 != 0 and id<(select count(student) from seat) then (select student from seat where id = (i.id+1) )  
    else student
end as student
from seat i 
```
