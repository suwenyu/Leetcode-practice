## 443. String Compression

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
 

Example 2:

Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
 

Example 3:

Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        int j = 0, ans = 0;
        for(int i=0; i < chars.size(); i++){
            if((i+1 == chars.size()) || chars[i+1] != chars[i]){
                chars[ans] = chars[i];
                ans++;
                if(j < i){
                    for(auto c:to_string(i-j+1)){
                        chars[ans] = c;
                        ans++;
                    }
                }
                j = i+1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
};
```
跑過每個char 再把count 用string存下來

### Others Solution
