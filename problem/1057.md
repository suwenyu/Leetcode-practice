## 1057. Campus Bikes

On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are N workers and M bikes, with N <= M. Each worker and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.

Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the bike to that worker. (If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.

The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.

Return a vector ans of length N, where ans[i] is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the i-th worker is assigned to.


### Example
```
Input: workers = [[0,0],[2,1]], bikes = [[1,2],[3,3]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: 
Worker 1 grabs Bike 0 as they are closest (without ties), and Worker 0 is assigned Bike 1. So the output is [1, 0].

Input: workers = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0]], bikes = [[1,0],[2,2],[2,1]]
Output: [0,2,1]
Explanation: 
Worker 0 grabs Bike 0 at first. Worker 1 and Worker 2 share the same distance to Bike 2, thus Worker 1 is assigned to Bike 2, and Worker 2 will take Bike 1. So the output is [0,2,1].


```

### My Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def dist(self, worker, bike):
        return abs(worker[0]-bike[0]) + abs(worker[1]-bike[1])
    
    def assignBikes(self, workers, bikes):
        """
        :type workers: List[List[int]]
        :type bikes: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        distmap = collections.defaultdict(list)
        distances = []
        for w_idx, worker in enumerate(workers):
            for b_idx, bike in enumerate(bikes):
                # distances.append((self.dist(worker, bike), w_idx, b_idx))
                dis = self.dist(worker, bike)
                distmap[dis].append((w_idx, b_idx))
            
            # distances.sort()
        
        bikes_used = set()
        res = [None] * len(workers)
        
        for dist in sorted(distmap.keys()):
            candidates = sorted(distmap[dist])
            for w, b in candidates:
                if res[w] is None and b not in bikes_used:
                    res[w] = b
                    bikes_used.add(b)
        return res   
```


### Others Solution
```python
    def assignBikes(self, workers, bikes):
        distances = []     # distances[worker] is tuple of (distance, worker, bike) for each bike 
        for i, (x, y) in enumerate(workers):
            distances.append([])
            for j, (x_b, y_b) in enumerate(bikes):
                distance = abs(x - x_b) + abs(y - y_b)
                distances[-1].append((distance, i, j))
            distances[-1].sort(reverse = True)  # reverse so we can pop the smallest distance
        
        result = [None] * len(workers)
        used_bikes = set()
        queue = [distances[i].pop() for i in range(len(workers))]   # smallest distance for each worker
        heapq.heapify(queue)
        
        while len(used_bikes) < len(workers):
            _, worker, bike = heapq.heappop(queue)
            if bike not in used_bikes:
                result[worker] = bike
                used_bikes.add(bike)
            else:
                heapq.heappush(queue, distances[worker].pop())  # bike used, add next closest bike
        
        return result
```
