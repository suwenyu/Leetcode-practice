## 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree

Given the root of a binary search tree with distinct values, modify it so that every node has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to node.val.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

```
Example 1:

Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

### My Code
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* helper(TreeNode* root, int& val){
        if(root->right)
            helper(root->right, val);
        val = root->val + val;
        root->val = val;
        if(root->left)
            helper(root->left, val);
        
        return root;
    }
    TreeNode* bstToGst(TreeNode* root) {
        int val = 0;
        helper(root, val);
        return root;
    }
};
```
