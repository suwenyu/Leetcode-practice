## 684. Redundant Connection

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

### Example
```
Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3

Example 2:
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int>parents(edges.size()+1, 0);
        
        vector<int> ans;
        for(auto e: edges){
            int v1 = e[0], v2 = e[1];
            while(parents[v1]){
                v1 = parents[v1];
                cout << v1 << " ";
            }
            while(parents[v2]) v2 = parents[v2];
            
            if(v1 == v2) return e;
            parents[v1] = v2;
            
        }
        return vector<int>();
        
    }
};
```
把母節點記錄在vector裡，每次edge讀進來，從parents往下跑到底
假如左右得到一樣表示這個edge會產生graph 因此去除這個edge
