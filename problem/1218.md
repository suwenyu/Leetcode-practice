## 1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference

Given an integer array arr and an integer difference, return the length of the longest subsequence in arr which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals difference.


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.

Example 3:

Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int difference) {
        int ans = 1;
        unordered_map<int, int>mp;
        
        for(auto &i: arr){
            mp[i] = 1 + mp[i-difference];
            ans = max(ans, mp[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
Observation
At each integer i in the array we can consider it as the end of AP(Arithmetic Progression/Sequence) and check the length of that AP which will be the length of AP that ends with i-difference + 1. We can thus use a hashmap to store this while traversing the array.

Complexity
Space: O(n)
Time: O(n)
