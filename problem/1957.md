## 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

### Example

Example 1

```text
Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation:
Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".
```

Example 2

```text
Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation:
Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".
Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".
```

Example 3

```text
Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aab"
Explanation: No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aab".
```

### Code

Method 1.
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string makeFancyString(string s) {
        char prev_char = s[0];
        int prev_count = 1;
        string ans;
        ans += prev_char;
        
        for(int i = 1 ; i < s.size() ; i++){
            if(s[i] == prev_char){
                if(prev_count < 2){
                    // cout<< "test1: " << prev_char << " " << prev_count << " " << s[i] << endl;
                    ans.push_back(s[i]);
                }
                prev_count++;
            }
            else{
                // cout << "test2: " << prev_char << " " << prev_count << " " << s[i] << endl;
                ans.push_back(s[i]);
                prev_char = s[i];
                prev_count = 1;
            }
            
        }
        
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

Method 2.

Two Pointers

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

```c++
string makeFancyString(string s) {
    int j = 2;
    for (int i = 2; i < s.size(); ++i)
        if (s[i] != s[j - 1] || s[i] != s[j - 2])
            s[j++] = s[i];
    s.resize(min(j, (int)s.size()));
    return s;
}
```
