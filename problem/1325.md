## 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).


### Example
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/09/sample_1_1684.png "img")
```
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
```

```
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
```

![img2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/15/sample_3_1684.png "img2")
```
Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
```

```
Example 4:

Input: root = [1,1,1], target = 1
Output: []
```

```
Example 5:

Input: root = [1,2,3], target = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
```


### My Code
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        if(!root)
            return NULL;
        
        TreeNode* left, *right;
        
        left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
        right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);
        
        // cout << root->val << endl;
        if(left == NULL)
            root->left = NULL;
        // else
        //     cout << root->val << " ";
        
        if(right == NULL)
            root->right = NULL;
        // else
        //     cout << root->val;
        // cout << endl;
        
        
        if(left == NULL && right == NULL && root->val == target){
            cout << root->val << endl;
            return NULL;
        }
        
        return root;
        
    }
};
```

### Others Solution
```c++
TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
    if (root->left) root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
    if (root->right) root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);
    return root->left == root->right && root->val == target ? NULL : root;
}
```
