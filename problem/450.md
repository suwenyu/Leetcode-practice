## 450. Delete Node in a BST

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

### Example

```
Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7
```

### My Code
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* helper(TreeNode* root, int key){
        if(root == NULL)
            return NULL;
        if(root->val == key){
            if(!root->right){
                TreeNode* left = root->left;
                delete root;
                return left;
            }
            else{
                TreeNode* right =  root->right;
                while(right->left)
                    right = right->left;
                swap(root->val, right->val);
            }
        }
        root->left = helper(root->left, key);
        root->right = helper(root->right, key);
        return root;
    }
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        return helper(root, key);
    }
};
