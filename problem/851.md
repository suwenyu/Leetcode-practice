## 851. Loud and Rich

In a group of N people (labelled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1), each person has different amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.

For convenience, we'll call the person with label x, simply "person x".

We'll say that richer[i] = [x, y] if person x definitely has more money than person y.  Note that richer may only be a subset of valid observations.

Also, we'll say quiet[x] = q if person x has quietness q.

Now, return answer, where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person x.

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
answer[0] = 5.
Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.

answer[7] = 7.
Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7
(which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x])
is person 7.

The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(int i, vector<int>& quiet, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& mp, vector<int>& ans){
        if(ans[i] >= 0)
            return ans[i];
        
        ans[i] = i;
        for(int j : mp[i]){
            int tmp = dfs(j, quiet, mp, ans);
            if(quiet[ans[i]] > quiet[tmp])
                ans[i] = ans[j];
        }
        return ans[i];
    }
    vector<int> loudAndRich(vector<vector<int>>& richer, vector<int>& quiet) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> mp;
        vector<int> ans(quiet.size(), -1);
        
        for(auto rich : richer){
            mp[rich[1]].push_back(rich[0]);
        }
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < quiet.size() ; i++)
            dfs(i, quiet, mp, ans);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
