## 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

### Example
```
Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.

public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>>dp(n+2, vector<int>(n+2, 0));
        for(int i = 1 ;i <= n; i++){
            for(int j = i - 1; j >= 1; j--){
                int min_val = INT_MAX;
                for(int k = j; k <= i; k++){
                    int tmp = k + max(dp[j][k-1], dp[k+1][i]);
                    min_val = min(min_val, tmp);
                }
                dp[j][i] = min_val;
            }
        }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>>dp(n+2, vector<int>(n+2, 0));
        
        for(int len = 2 ; len <= n ; len++){
            for(int i = 1 ; i <= n-len+1 ; i++){
                
                int j = i + len - 1;
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                
                for(int k = i ; k <= j ; k++)
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], k + max(dp[i][k-1], dp[k+1][j]));
            }
        }
        
        
        // for(auto i : dp){
        //     for(auto j : i){
        //         cout << j << " ";
        //     }
        //     cout << endl;
        // }
