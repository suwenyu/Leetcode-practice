## 69. Sqrt(x)

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.


### Example
```
Input: 4
Output: 2

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

### My Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        tmp = [pow(i,2) for i in range(100000)]
        while count < len(tmp):
            if tmp[count] > x:
                return count-1
            count += 1
        return 0
```

### Others Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        r = x
        while r*r > x:
            r = (r + x/r) / 2
        return r
