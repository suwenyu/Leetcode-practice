## 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage expectation wage[i].

Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group.  When hiring a group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

1. Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
2. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions.


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.

Example 2:

Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], K = 3
Output: 30.66667
Explanation: We pay 4 to 0-th worker, 13.33333 to 2-th and 3-th workers seperately. 
```

### My Code
```c++
struct compare{
    bool operator()(pair<double, int>& a, pair<double, int>& b){
        return a.first < b.first;
    }
};

class Solution {

public:
    
    double mincostToHireWorkers(vector<int>& quality, vector<int>& wage, int K) {
        vector<pair<double, int>>workers;
        for(int i=0;i < quality.size(); i++)
            workers.push_back(make_pair((double)(wage[i])/quality[i], quality[i]));
        
        sort(workers.begin(), workers.end(), compare());
        
        double res = DBL_MAX, qsum = 0;
        priority_queue<int>pq;
        for(auto w: workers){
            qsum += w.second;
            pq.push(w.second);
            if(pq.size() > K){
                qsum -= pq.top();
                pq.pop();
            }
            if(pq.size() == K)
                res = min(res, qsum * w.first);
        }
        return res;
        
    }
};
```
先依照薪水與價值的比例排序，並且與價值一起存下來
接下來用priority queue 存前面價值最少的幾個工人，並且計算總工資
Time:  O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)

**注意sort operator的用法 與priority_queue 不同**

### Others Solution
```c++
// Time:  O(nlogn)
// Space: O(n)
class Solution {
public:
    double mincostToHireWorkers(vector<int>& quality, vector<int>& wage, int K) {
        vector<pair<double, int>> workers;
        for (int i = 0; i < quality.size(); ++i) {
            workers.emplace_back(static_cast<double>(wage[i]) / quality[i],
                                 quality[i]);
        }
        sort(workers.begin(), workers.end());
        auto result = numeric_limits<double>::max();
        auto sum = 0.0;
        priority_queue<int> max_heap;
        for (const auto& worker: workers) {
            sum += worker.second;
            max_heap.emplace(worker.second);
            if (max_heap.size() > K) {
                sum -= max_heap.top(), max_heap.pop();
            }
            if (max_heap.size() == K) {
                result = min(result, sum * worker.first);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};

```

descriptions:
1. Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
2. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
For every worker, he has an expected ratio of wage compared to his quality.
