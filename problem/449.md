## 449. Serialize and Deserialize BST

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.


### Example

```
Input:
{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
```

### My Code
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Codec {
public:

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        string ans = "";
        q.push(root);
        while(!q.empty()){
            TreeNode* tmp = q.front();
            if(tmp){
                ans += to_string(tmp->val) + " ";

                q.push(tmp->left);
                q.push(tmp->right);
            }
            else{
                ans += "null ";
            }
            q.pop();
            
        }
        return ans;
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        vector<TreeNode*> vec;
        
        stringstream n(data);
        string tmp;
        while(getline(n, tmp, ' ')){
            if(tmp == "null")
                vec.push_back(NULL);
            else
                vec.push_back(new TreeNode(stoi(tmp)));
        }
        int pos = 0, offset = 1;
        while(offset < vec.size()){
            if(vec[pos] != NULL){
                vec[pos]->left = vec[offset];
                offset++;
                if(offset < vec.size()){
                    vec[pos]->right = vec[offset];
                    offset++;
                }
            }
            pos += 1;
        }
        return vec[0];
        
    }
};

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec codec;
// codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root));
```
