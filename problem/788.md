## 788. Rotated Digits
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?

### Example
```
Example:
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: 
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rotatedDigits(int N) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
            
            bool flag=false;
            bool ans = false;
            bool rotate = false;
            
            int num = i;
            
            while(num>=1){
                int bit=num%10;
                // cout << bit << endl;
                if(bit==0 || bit==1 || bit==8)
                    ans = ans || true;
                else if(bit==2 || bit==5 || bit==6 || bit==9)
                    rotate = rotate || true;
                else{
                    ans = false;
                    rotate = false;
                    break;
                }
                num=num/10;
            }
            flag = (ans && rotate) || rotate;
            if(flag==true)
                count+=1;
        }
        // cout << count << endl;
        return count;
    }
};
```
