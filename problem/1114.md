## 1114. Print in Order

Suppose we have a class:
```java
public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
```
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().


### Example
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.

Input: [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
```

### My Code
```c++
class Foo {
private:
    promise<void> p1;
    promise<void> p2;
public:
    Foo() {
    }

    void first(function<void()> printFirst) {
        
        // printFirst() outputs "first". Do not change or remove this line.
        printFirst();
        p1.set_value();
    }

    void second(function<void()> printSecond) {
        
        // printSecond() outputs "second". Do not change or remove this line.
        p1.get_future().wait();
        printSecond();
        p2.set_value();        
    }

    void third(function<void()> printThird) {
        
        // printThird() outputs "third". Do not change or remove this line.
        p2.get_future().wait();
        printThird();
    }
};
```
c++ multi thread prromise 用法
