## 526. Beautiful Arrangement

Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

1. The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
2. i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 

Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2

Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
```


### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(int N, int i, vector<bool>& visited){
        if(i > N)
            return 1;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int n = 1; n < N+1; n++){
            if(visited[n])
                continue;
            if(n % i != 0 && i % n != 0)
                continue;
            
            visited[n] = true;
            sum += dfs(N, i+1, visited);
            visited[n] = false;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    int countArrangement(int N) {
        if(N < 1)
            return 0;
        vector<bool> visited(N+1, false);
        
        return dfs(N, 1, visited);
    }
};
```
