## 1120. Maximum Average Subtree

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)



### Example
![img1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/09/1308_example_1.png "img1")
```
Input: [5,6,1]
Output: 6.00000
Explanation: 
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.
```

### My Code
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    pair<int, int> helper(TreeNode* root, double& ans){
        if(root == NULL)
            return {0, 0};
        
        pair<int, int> left, right;
        if(root->left)
            left = helper(root->left, ans);
        if(root->right)
            right = helper(root->right, ans);
        
        
        ans = max(ans, (double)(left.second + right.second + root->val)/(left.first + right.first + 1) );
        
        return {left.first + right.first+1, left.second + right.second+root->val};
        
    }
    
    double maximumAverageSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        double ans = 0;
        auto tmp = helper(root, ans);
        // cout << tmp.first << " " << tmp.second << endl;
        return ans;
    }
};
