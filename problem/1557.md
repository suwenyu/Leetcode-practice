## 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes

Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.


### Example
Example 1

![img1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/07/untitled22.png "img1")
```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]
Output: [0,3]
Explanation: It's not possible to reach all the nodes from a single vertex. From 0 we can reach [0,1,2,5]. From 3 we can reach [3,4,2,5]. So we output [0,3].
```

Example 2
![img2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/07/untitled.png "img2")
```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,1],[1,4],[2,4]]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Notice that vertices 0, 3 and 2 are not reachable from any other node, so we must include them. Also any of these vertices can reach nodes 1 and 4.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 123456789
Output: "123.456.789"
```

Example 4:
```
Input: n = 0
Output: "0"
```


### Code
1. Method 1

Quick prove:

- All nodes with no in-degree must in the final result,
because they can not be reached from
All other nodes can be reached from any other nodes.
- All other nodes can be reached from some other nodes.

Complexity
Time O(N)
Space O(N)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int> ans;
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        for(auto e : edges)
            visited[e[1]] = true;
        
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < visited.size() ; i++){
            if(visited[i] == 0)
                ans.push_back(i);
        }
        
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
