## 812. Largest Triangle Area

You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

### Example
```
Example:
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    double largestTriangleArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    
        double res = 0;
        for (auto &i : points)
            for (auto &j : points)
                for (auto &k : points)
            res = max(res, 0.5 * abs(i[0] * j[1] + j[0] * k[1] + k[0] * i[1]- j[0] * i[1] - k[0] * j[1] - i[0] * k[1]));
        return res;
    }
};
```
