## 202. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

### Example
```
Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> s;
        
        while(n != 1){
            int a = 0;
            while(n >= 1){
                int tmp = n % 10;
                n /= 10;
                a += pow(tmp, 2);
            }
            if(s.find(a) != s.end())
                return false;
            s.insert(a);
            n = a;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
