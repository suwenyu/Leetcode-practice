## 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings

There are n flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.

We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking bookings[i] = [i, j, k] means that we booked k seats from flights labeled i to j inclusive.

Return an array answer of length n, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
        vector<int>ans(n+1, 0);
        for(auto b: bookings){
            ans[b[0] - 1] += b[2];
            ans[b[1]] -= b[2];
        }
        for(int i = 1 ; i < n ; i++)
            ans[i] += ans[i-1]; 
        return {ans.begin(), ans.end()-1};
    }
};
```
