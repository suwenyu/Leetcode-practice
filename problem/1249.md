## 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses

Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters. 

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

* It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
* It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
* It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
 

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.


Example 2:

Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"


Example 3:

Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.


Example 4:

Input: s = "(a(b(c)d)"
Output: "a(b(c)d)"
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string minRemoveToMakeValid(string s) {
        stack<int> st;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < s.size() ; i++){
            if(s[i] == '(')
                st.push(i);
            if(s[i] == ')'){
                if(!st.empty())
                    st.pop();
                else
                    s[i] = '*';
            }
        }
        while(!st.empty()){
            s[st.top()] = '*';
            st.pop();
        }
        
        string ans = "";
        for(int i = 0 ; i < s.size() ; i++){
            if(s[i] != '*')
                ans += s[i];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
Explanation:

To make the string valid with minimum removes, we need to remove all parentheses that do not have a matching pair.

1. Push char index into the stack when we see '('.

2. Pop from the stack when we see ')'.

If the stack is empty, then we have ')' without the pair, and it needs to be removed.
In the end, the stack will contain indexes of '(' without the pair, if any. We need to remove all of them too.

> We mark removed parentheses with '*', and erase all of them in the end. In Java, it will be faster to biuld the result string in StringBuilder, but it could be tricky to track the offset when removing '(' in the end.


time complexity : O(N)
space complexity : O(N)
