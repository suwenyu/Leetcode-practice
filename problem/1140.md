## 1140. Stone Game II

Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, M = 1.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:  If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alex takes two piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. 
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameII(vector<int>& piles) {
        int n = piles.size();
        vector<vector<int>>dp(n+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        vector<int>preSum(n+1, 0);
        for(int i = n-1 ; i >= 0; i--){
            preSum[i] = preSum[i+1] + piles[i];
        }
        for(int i = 0 ; i <= n; i++)
            dp[i][n] = preSum[i];
        
        for(int i = n-1; i>= 0; i--){
            for(int j = n-1; j >= 1 ; j--){
                for(int x = 1 ; x <= 2 *j && i+x <=n ; x++){
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], preSum[i] - dp[i+x][max(j, x)]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][1];
    }
};
