## 261. Graph Valid Tree

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.


### Example

```
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
Output: true


Example 2:

Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]
Output: false
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool validTree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<int>parents(n, 0);
        for(auto e: edges){
            int e1 = e[0];
            int e2 = e[1];
            
            while(parents[e1])
                e1 = parents[e1];
            while(parents[e2])
                e2 = parents[e2];
            if(e1 == e2)
                return false;
            parents[e1] = e2;
        }
        
        return edges.size() == n-1;
    }
};
```
1. Make sure there is no cycle in the graph - this has to be a none-cyclic graph
2. Make sure every node is reached - this has to be a connected graph
