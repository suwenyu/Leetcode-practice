## 1954. Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples

In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted at every integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate (i, j) has |i| + |j| apples growing on it.

You will buy an axis-aligned square plot of land that is centered at (0, 0).

Given an integer neededApples, return the minimum perimeter of a plot such that at least neededApples apples are inside or on the perimeter of that plot.

The value of |x| is defined as:

- x if x >= 0
- -x if x < 0

### Example

Example 1

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/30/1527_example_1_2.png "img")

```text
Input: neededApples = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: A square plot of side length 1 does not contain any apples.
However, a square plot of side length 2 has 12 apples inside (as depicted in the image above).
The perimeter is 2 * 4 = 8.
```

Example 2

```text
Input: neededApples = 13
Output: 16
```

Example 3

```text
Input: neededApples = 1000000000
Output: 5040
```

### Code

Greedy

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumPerimeter(long long neededApples) {
        long long total_apple = 0;
        long long prev_apple = 0;
        long long delta = -12;
        
        int i;
        for(i = 1 ; ; i++){
            
            delta += 24;
            prev_apple += delta;
            total_apple += prev_apple;

            if(total_apple >= neededApples){
                break;
            }
            
        }
        // cout << total_apple << endl;
        cout << i << endl;
        
        return i * 8;
    }
};
```

```c++
long long minimumPerimeter(long long x) {
    long long l = 1,  r = 100000, m;
    while (l < r) {
        m = (l + r) / 2;
        if (m * m * m * 4 + m * m * 6 + m * 2 >= x)
            r = m;
        else
            l = m + 1;
    }
    return l * 8;
}
```
