## 1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word

Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

### Example

Example 1:

```text
Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".
```

### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfStrings(vector<string>& patterns, string word) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(string pattern : patterns){
            if(word.find(pattern) != string::npos)
                ans += 1;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

Note that the find function in C++ is O(n + m), as it uses KPM.

time complexity : O(N * (M+K))
space complexity: O(1)
