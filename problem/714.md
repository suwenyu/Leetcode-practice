## 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

### Example
```
Example 1:
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
    Buying at prices[0] = 1
    Selling at prices[3] = 8
    Buying at prices[4] = 4
    Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if(n < 2)
            return 0;
        
        vector<int> hold(n, 0), sold(n, 0);
        hold[0] = -prices[0];
        
        for(int i = 1 ; i < n ; i++){
            
            hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], sold[i-1] - prices[i]);
            sold[i] = max(sold[i-1], hold[i-1] - fee + prices[i]);
        }
        
        return sold[n-1];
    }
};
```
