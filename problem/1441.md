## 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations

Given an array target and an integer n. In each iteration, you will read a number from  list = {1,2,3..., n}.

Build the target array using the following operations:

* Push: Read a new element from the beginning list, and push it in the array.
* Pop: delete the last element of the array.
* If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.
You are guaranteed that the target array is strictly increasing, only containing numbers between 1 to n inclusive.

Return the operations to build the target array.

You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.


### Example
Example 1:
```
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation: 
Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]
Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]
Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
Explanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop.
```

Example 4:
```
Input: target = [2,3,4], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Pop","Push","Push","Push"]
```


### Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> buildArray(vector<int>& target, int n) {
        unordered_set<int> set(target.begin(), target.end());
        vector<int> tmp;
        
        vector<string> ans;
        for(int i = 1 ; i <= n ; i++){
            ans.push_back("Push");
            tmp.push_back(i);
            
            if(set.find(i) == set.end()){
                ans.push_back("Pop");
                tmp.pop_back();
            }
            
            if(target.size() == tmp.size())
                break;
            
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

other code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> buildArray(vector<int>& target, int n) {
        int i = 1;
        vector<string> ans;
        for (int j = 0; j < target.size(); j++) {
            while (i <= n && i != target[j]) {
                ans.push_back("Push");
                ans.push_back("Pop");
                i++;
            }
            ans.push_back("Push");
            i++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
