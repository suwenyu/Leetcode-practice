## 503. Next Greater Element II

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

### Example
```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.


```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int>ans(nums.size(),-1);
        stack<int>s;
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size()*2; i++){
            int num = nums[i%nums.size()];
            
            while(!s.empty() && nums[s.top()] < num){
                ans[s.top()] = num;
                s.pop();
            }
            if (i < nums.size()) s.push(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
        
};
```
把跑過的存到stack裡面，跑到下一個的時候檢查前一個是不是比他還小，
如果是的話，放進去answer裡面 並且pop掉
