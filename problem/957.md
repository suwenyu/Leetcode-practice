## 957. Prison Cells After N Days

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)



### Example
```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]


Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> prisonAfterNDays(vector<int>& cells, int N) {
        // for(int n = 0 ; n < N ; n++){ 
        for(int n = 0 ; n < (N - 1) % 14 + 1 ; n++){
            vector<int>res(8, 0);
            for(int i = 1 ; i < 7 ; i++){
                res[i] = !(cells[i-1] ^ cells[i+1]);
            }
            cells = res;
        }
        return cells;
    }
};
```
原本的做法一定超時， n < N
所以要找規律 -> module 14 會有規律
因此找到規律就能快很多


### Others Solution
```c++
vector<int> prisonAfterNDays(vector<int>& c, int N) {
  vector<int> f_c, next_c(c.size(), 0);
  for (int cycle = 0; N-- > 0; c = next_c, ++cycle) {
    for (auto i = 1; i < c.size() - 1; ++i) next_c[i] = c[i - 1] == c[i + 1];
    if (cycle == 0) f_c = next_c;
    else if (next_c == f_c) N %= cycle;
  }
  return c;
}
```
