## 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

```
    4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9
```

### Example
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list
             should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

```

### Others Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        // cout << node->next;
        
        auto next = node->next;
        *node = *next;
        delete next;
    }
};
```
