## 1124. Longest Well-Performing Interval

We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8.

A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.



### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestWPI(vector<int>& hours) {
        int ans = 0, sum = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> seen;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < hours.size() ; i++){
            sum += hours[i] > 8 ? 1 : -1;
            
            if(sum > 0){
                ans = i + 1;
            }
            else{
                if(seen.find(sum) == seen.end())
                    seen[sum] = i;
                if(seen.find(sum-1) != seen.end()){
                    ans = max(ans, i - seen[sum-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
