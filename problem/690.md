## 690. Employee Importance

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, his importance value and his direct subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.

### My Code
```c++
```

### Others Solution
```c++
/*
// Employee info
class Employee {
public:
    // It's the unique ID of each node.
    // unique id of this employee
    int id;
    // the importance value of this employee
    int importance;
    // the id of direct subordinates
    vector<int> subordinates;
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        
        unordered_map<int, Employee*> map;
        
        for(const auto element : employees){
            
            map[element->id] = element;
        }
        cout << map[1] << endl;
        
        return help(map, id);
    }
    
    int help(unordered_map<int, Employee*>& map, const int id){
        
        auto sum = map[id]->importance;
        
        for(const auto element : map[id]->subordinates){
            
            sum += help(map, element);
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
