## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### My Code
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int ans=0, tmp=0;
        unordered_map<char, int>map;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            auto it=map.find(s[i]);
            if(it != map.end() && tmp <= map[s[i]])
                tmp = map[s[i]]+1;
            else
                ans = max(ans, i-tmp+1);
            map[s[i]] = i;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
