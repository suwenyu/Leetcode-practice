## 522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II

Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.

An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.

A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.

- For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).

### Example

Example 1

```text
Input: strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"]
Output: 3
```

Example 2

```text
Input: strs = ["aaa","aaa","aa"]
Output: -1
```

### Code

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool LCS(string& a, string& b){
        if(b.size() < a.size())
            return false;
        
        int i = 0;
        for(auto ch : b){
            if(i < a.size() && a[i] == ch) i++;
        }
        return i == a.size();
    }
    int findLUSlength(vector<string>& strs) {
        int n = strs.size();
        if(strs.empty()) 
            return -1;
        
        int rst = -1;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
            int j = 0;
            for(; j < n ; j++){
                if(i == j)
                    continue;
                if(LCS(strs[i], strs[j])) break;
            }
            if(j == n )
                rst = max(rst, (int)(strs[i].size()));
        }
        
        
        return rst;
    }
};
```
