## 1002. Find Common Characters

Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

### Example
```
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]

Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
```

### My Code
```C++
```

### Others Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> commonChars(vector<string>& A) {
        vector<string> arr;
        vector<int>cnt(26, INT_MAX);
        
        for(auto s: A){
            vector<int>cnt1(26, 0);
            for (auto c : s) ++cnt1[c - 'a'];
            for (int i=0;i < 26 ; i++)
                cnt[i] = min(cnt[i] , cnt1[i]);
            
        }
        for(int i=0 ; i < 26 ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < cnt[i] ;j++){
                arr.push_back(string(1, (i+'a')));
            }
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
};
```
Runtime: O(n), where n is the total number of characters.
Memory: O(1) (we use two fixed-size vectors).
