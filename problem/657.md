## 657. Judge Route Circle
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

### Example
```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```



### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int coordinate[2] = {0,0};
        for(int i=0;i<moves.length();i++){
            if(moves[i]=='U')
                coordinate[1]+=1;
            if(moves[i]=='D')
                coordinate[1]-=1;
            if(moves[i]=='L')
                coordinate[0]-=1;
            if(moves[i]=='R')
                coordinate[0]+=1;
        }
        if(coordinate[0]==0 && coordinate[1]==0)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
        
    }
};
```
