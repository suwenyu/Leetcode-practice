## 133. Clone Graph

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.


### Example
![img1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/19/113_sample.png "img1")
```
Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
```

### My Code
```c++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        if(node == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*>mp;

        queue<Node*> q;
        Node* newNode = new Node(node->val, {});
        q.push(node);
        
        mp[node] = newNode;
        
        while(!q.empty()){
            Node* tmp = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            for(auto nei : tmp->neighbors){
                if(mp.find(nei) == mp.end()){
                    mp[nei] = new Node(nei->val, {});
                    q.push(nei);
                }
                mp[tmp]->neighbors.push_back(mp[nei]); 
            }
        }
        
        return newNode;
    }
};
```
