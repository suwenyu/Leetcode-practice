## 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

### Example
```
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

```

### Others Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minMoves(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum_of_elems = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        int min_num = *min_element(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        
        return sum_of_elems - min_num * nums.size();
    }
};
```
##### Discuss
let's define sum as the sum of all the numbers, before any moves; minNum as the min number int the list; n is the length of the list;

After, say m moves, we get all the numbers as x , and we will get the following equation
```
sum + m * (n - 1) = x * n
```
and actually,
```
x = minNum + m
```
This part may be a little confusing, but @shijungg explained very well. let me explain a little again. it comes from two observations:

* the minum number will always be minum until it reachs the final number, because every move, other numbers (besides the max) will be increamented too;
* from above, we can get, the minum number will be incremented in every move. So, if the final number is x, it would be minNum + moves;
and finally, we will get

```
sum - minNum * n = m
```
