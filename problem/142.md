## 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

### Example
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

### My Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        visited = set()
        
        count = 0
        while head and head.next:
            if head in visited:
                return head
            
            visited.add(head)  
            head = head.next
        
        return None
    

```


### Others Solution
```python
Consider the following linked list, where E is the cylce entry and X, the crossing point of fast and slow.
        H: distance from head to cycle entry E
        D: distance from E to X
        L: cycle length
                          _____
                         /     \
        head_____H______E       \
                        \       /
                         X_____/   
        
    
        If fast and slow both start at head, when fast catches slow, slow has traveled H+D and fast 2(H+D). 
        Assume fast has traveled n loops in the cycle, we have:
        2H + 2D = H + D + L  -->  H + D = nL  --> H = nL - D
        Thus if two pointers start from head and X, respectively, one first reaches E, the other also reaches E. 
        In my solution, since fast starts at head.next, we need to move slow one step forward in the beginning of part 2

class Solution:
    # @param head, a ListNode
    # @return a list node
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        try:
            fast = head.next
            slow = head
            while fast is not slow:
                fast = fast.next.next
                slow = slow.next
        except:
            # if there is an exception, we reach the end and there is no cycle
            return None

        # since fast starts at head.next, we need to move slow one step forward
        slow = slow.next
        while head is not slow:
            head = head.next
            slow = slow.next

        return head
```
