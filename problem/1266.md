## 1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points

On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.

You can move according to the next rules:

* In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
* You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.


### Example
![img1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/14/1626_example_1.PNG "img1")
```
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
```

```
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        // int x = points[0][0], y = points[0][1];
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 1 ; i < points.size() ; i++){
            ans += max(abs(points[i][0]-points[i-1][0]), abs(points[i][1]-points[i-1][1]));
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Others Solution
