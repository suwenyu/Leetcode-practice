## 1955. Count Number of Special Subsequences

A sequence is special if it consists of a positive number of 0s, followed by a positive number of 1s, then a positive number of 2s.

- For example, [0,1,2] and [0,0,1,1,1,2] are special.
- In contrast, [2,1,0], [1], and [0,1,2,0] are not special.

Given an array nums (consisting of only integers 0, 1, and 2), return the number of different subsequences that are special. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Two subsequences are different if the set of indices chosen are different.

### Example

Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The special subsequences are [0,1,2,2], [0,1,2,2], and [0,1,2,2].
```

Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,0,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no special subsequences in [2,2,0,0].
```

Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [0,1,2,0,1,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: The special subsequences are:
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
- [0,1,2,0,1,2]
```

### Explanation

dp[0] means the number of special sequence of 0.
dp[1] means the number of special sequence of 0,1.
dp[2] means the number of special sequence 0,1,2.

Iterate each element a in the input A,

If a = 0, dp[0] += dp[0] + 1
Itself is a special sequence of 0,
and it extend all previous special sequence of 0.

If a = 1, dp[1] += dp[1] + dp[0]
Because, it extends all previous special sequence of 0.
and it extends all previous special sequence of 1.

If a = 2, dp[1] += dp[2] + dp[1]
Because, it extends all previous special sequence of 2.
and it extends all previous special sequence of 1.

In example 1, we have [0,1,2],
now A[3] = 2
[0,1,2] + [2] = [0,1,2,2]
[0,1] + [2] = [0,1,2]
So the answer is 2.

### Complexity

Time O(n)
Space O(1)

### Code

```c++
int countSpecialSubsequences(vector<int>& A) {
    vector<int> dp = {0, 0, 0};
    int mod = 1e9 + 7;
    for (int& a: A)
        dp[a] = ((dp[a] + dp[a]) % mod + (a > 0 ? dp[a-1] : 1)) % mod;
    return dp[2];
}
```
