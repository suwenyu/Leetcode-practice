## 397. Integer Replacement

Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:

If n is even, replace n with n/2.
If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input:
8

Output:
3

Explanation:
8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1


Example 2:

Input:
7

Output:
4

Explanation:
7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
or
7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int integerReplacement(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        long tmp = n;
        
        while(tmp > 1){
            ans += 1;
            if(tmp % 2 == 0)
                tmp /= 2;
            else if((tmp % 4) == 1 || tmp == 3)
                tmp -= 1;
            else
                tmp += 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```


### Others Solution
##### Explanation
What is not so obvious is what to do with odd numbers. One may think that you just need to remove as many 1's as possible to increase the evenness of the number. Wrong! Look at this example:

```
111011 -> 111010 -> 11101 -> 11100 -> 1110 -> 111 -> 1000 -> 100 -> 10 -> 1
```
And yet, this is not the best way because

```
111011 -> 111100 -> 11110 -> 1111 -> 10000 -> 1000 -> 100 -> 10 -> 1
```

See? Both 111011 -> 111010 and 111011 -> 111100 remove the same number of 1's, but the second way is better.

So, we just need to remove as many 1's as possible, doing +1 in case of a tie? Not quite. The infamous test with n=3 fails for that strategy because 11 -> 10 -> 1 is better than 11 -> 100 -> 10 -> 1. Fortunately, that's the only exception (or at least I can't think of any other, and there are none in the tests).

```
So the logic is:

If n is even, halve it.
If n=3 or n-1 has less 1's than n+1, decrement n.
Otherwise, increment n.
```
