## 998. Maximum Binary Tree II

We are given the root node of a maximum tree: a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.

Just as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from an list A (root = Construct(A)) recursively with the following Construct(A) routine:

1. If A is empty, return null.
Otherwise, let A[i] be the largest element of A.  Create a root node with value A[i].
2. The left child of root will be Construct([A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]])
3. The right child of root will be Construct([A[i+1], A[i+2], ..., A[A.length - 1]])
4. Return root.

Note that we were not given A directly, only a root node root = Construct(A).

Suppose B is a copy of A with the value val appended to it.  It is guaranteed that B has unique values.

Return Construct(B).

```
Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
Explanation: A = [1,4,2,3], B = [1,4,2,3,5]
```

### My Code
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* insertIntoMaxTree(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(val), *curr = root;
        
        if(root->val < val){
            node->left = root;
            return node;
        }
        
        while(curr->right && curr->right->val > val){
            curr = curr->right;
        }
        
        node->left = curr->right;
        curr->right = node;
        
        return root;
    }
};
```
Time Complexity:
O(N) time,
O(N) recursion space.

### Others Solution
```c++
TreeNode* insertIntoMaxTree(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root && root->val > val) {
        root->right = insertIntoMaxTree(root->right, val);
        return root;
    }
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(val);
    node->left = root;
    return node;        
}
```
