## 937. Reorder Log Files

You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:

Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

Return the final order of the logs.

### Example
```
Input: ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]

```

### My Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs):
        """
        :type logs: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        num = []
        letter= []
        
        for l in logs:
            if l[(l.find(' ')+1)].isdigit():
                num.append(l)
            else:
                letter.append(l)
        
        return sorted(letter, key = lambda x: (x[x.find(" "):], x[:x.find(" ")])) + list(num)
        
```


### Others Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs):
        l = filter(lambda l: l[l.find(" ") + 1].isalpha(), logs)
        d = filter(lambda l: l[l.find(" ") + 1].isdigit(), logs)
        return sorted(l, key = lambda x: (x[x.find(" "):], x[:x.find(" ")])) + list(d)
```
