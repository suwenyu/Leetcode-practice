## 830. Positions of Large Groups
In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".

Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

### Example
```
Input: "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.

Input: "abc"
Output: []
Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.

Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]

```


### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string S) {
        int count = 1;
        int loc = 0;
        char word = S[0];
        vector<vector<int>>v;
        
        for(int i=0;i<S.length()-1;i++){
            if(S[i]!=S[i+1]){
                if(count > 2){
                    vector<int>v1;
                    v1.push_back(loc);
                    v1.push_back(i);
                    v.push_back(v1);
                }
                count = 1;
                loc = i+1;
                word = S[i+1];
            }
            // cout << i+1 << " " << count << endl;
            if(S[i]==S[i+1] && i==S.length()-2 && count >= 2){
                vector<int>v1;
                v1.push_back(loc);
                v1.push_back(i+1);
                v.push_back(v1);
            }
            if(S[i]==S[i+1]){
                count++;
            }
            
        }
        return v;
    }
};
```
### Others Solution
```c++
vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string S) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, N = S.size();
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        while (j < N) {
            while (j < N && S[j] == S[i]) ++j;
            if (j - i >= 3) res.push_back({i, j - 1});
            i = j;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
