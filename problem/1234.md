## 1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String

You are given a string containing only 4 kinds of characters 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R'.

A string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears n/4 times where n is the length of the string.

Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make the original string s balanced.

Return 0 if the string is already balanced.

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: s = "QWER"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already balanced.

Example 2:

Input: s = "QQWE"
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced.

Example 3:

Input: s = "QQQW"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". 

Example 4:

Input: s = "QQQQ"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can replace the last 3 'Q' to make s = "QWER".
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int balancedString(string s) {
        int n = s.size(), k = n/4;
        
        unordered_map<char, int> mp;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < s.size() ; i++)
            mp[s[i]]++;
        
        int left = 0;
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
            mp[s[i]]--;
            while(left < n && mp['Q'] <= k && mp['W'] <= k && mp['E'] <= k && mp['R'] <= k){
                ans = min(ans, i-left+1);
                mp[s[left]]++;
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
