## 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

### Example
```
Example 1:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".


Example 2:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRestaurant(vector<string>& list1, vector<string>& list2) {
        vector<string> ans;
        unordered_map<string, int> mp;
        
        int min = INT_MAX;
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < list1.size() ; i++)
            mp[list1[i]] = i;
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < list2.size() ; i++){
            if(mp.find(list2[i]) != mp.end()){
                if(mp[list2[i]] + i < min){
                    min = mp[list2[i]] + i;
                    ans.clear();
                    ans.push_back(list2[i]);
                }
                else if(mp[list2[i]] + i == min)
                    ans.push_back(list2[i]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
