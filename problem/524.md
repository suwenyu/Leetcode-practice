## 524. Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting

Given a string and a string dictionary, find the longest string in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given string. If there are more than one possible results, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.

### Example
```
Input:
s = "abpcplea", d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]

Output: 
"apple"

Input:
s = "abpcplea", d = ["a","b","c"]

Output: 
"a"
```

### My Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findLongestWord(self, s, d):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type d: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        # d.sort(key=len, reverse=True)
        # for x in d:
        for x in sorted(d, key=lambda x: (-len(x), x)):
            it = iter(s)
            if all(c in it for c in x):
                return x
        return ''
```
把list sort完，每個去判斷字母是不是在string中
找到直接return


### Others Solution
```python
def findLongestWord(self, s, d):
    heap = [(-len(word), word) for word in d]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    while heap:
        word = heapq.heappop(heap)[1]
        it = iter(s)
        if all(c in it for c in word):
            return word
    return ''
```
