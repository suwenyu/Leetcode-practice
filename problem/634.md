## 634. Find the Derangement of An Array

In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

There's originally an array consisting of n integers from 1 to n in ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 10^9 + 7.


### Example
```
Example 1:
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findDerangement(int n) {
        if (n <= 1)
            return 0;
        
        vector<long> dp(n+1, 0);
        dp[2] = 1;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        
        for(int i = 3 ; i <= n ; i++){
            dp[i] = (i-1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % mod;
        }
        
        return int(dp[n]);
    }
};
```
