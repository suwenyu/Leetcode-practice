## 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```


### Example
```
Example :

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

### My Code
```c++
// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int right = n, left = 0;
        while(true){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            int res = guess(mid);
            if(res == 0)
                return mid;
            if(res == 1)
                left = mid + 1;
        
            if(res == -1)
                right = mid - 1;
        }
        
    }
};
```
