## 1138. Alphabet Board Path

On an alphabet board, we start at position (0, 0), corresponding to character board[0][0].

Here, board = ["abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"], as shown in the diagram below.

We may make the following moves:

* 'U' moves our position up one row, if the position exists on the board;
* 'D' moves our position down one row, if the position exists on the board;
* 'L' moves our position left one column, if the position exists on the board;
* 'R' moves our position right one column, if the position exists on the board;
* '!' adds the character board[r][c] at our current position (r, c) to the answer.
(Here, the only positions that exist on the board are positions with letters on them.)

Return a sequence of moves that makes our answer equal to target in the minimum number of moves.  You may return any path that does so.

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: target = "leet"
Output: "DDR!UURRR!!DDD!"


Example 2:

Input: target = "code"
Output: "RR!DDRR!UUL!R!"

```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
    vector<string>board = {"abcde", "fghij", "klmno", "pqrst", "uvwxy", "z"};
public:
    string alphabetBoardPath(string target) {
        string ans = "";
        int x1 = 0, y1 = 0;
        for(auto t: target){
            int x = (t-'a') % 5;
            int y = (t-'a') / 5;
            ans += string(max(0, y1-y), 'U') + string(max(0, x-x1), 'R') + string(max(0, x1-x), 'L') + string(max(0, y-y1), 'D') + '!';
            x1 = x, y1 = y;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
