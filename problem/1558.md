![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/10/sample_2_1887.png "img")
Your task is to form an integer array nums from an initial array of zeros arr that is the same size as nums.

Return the minimum number of function calls to make nums from arr.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.


### Example
Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: Increment by 1 (second element): [0, 0] to get [0, 1] (1 operation).
Double all the elements: [0, 1] -> [0, 2] -> [0, 4] (2 operations).
Increment by 1 (both elements)  [0, 4] -> [1, 4] -> [1, 5] (2 operations).
Total of operations: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment by 1 (both elements) [0, 0] -> [0, 1] -> [1, 1] (2 operations).
Double all the elements: [1, 1] -> [2, 2] (1 operation).
Total of operations: 2 + 1 = 3.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [4,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: (initial)[0,0,0] -> [1,0,0] -> [1,0,1] -> [2,0,2] -> [2,1,2] -> [4,2,4] -> [4,2,5](nums).
```

Example 4:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,4]
Output: 7
```

Example 5:
```
Input: nums = [2,4,8,16]
Output: 8
```


### Code
1. Method 1

Intuition:
Think in backward way,
for each number a in A,
if a % 2 == 1, we do operation 0 backward, turning 1 to 0.
If all a % 2 == 0, we do operation 1 backward.

Some observation here:

- For each bit "1" in the bianry format of a,
we need at least one operation 0.
- All operation 1 can be shared.

Complexity
Time O(Nlog(10^9)))
Space O(1)


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0, max_len = 0;
        for(auto n : nums){
            int len = 0;
            while(n > 0){
                ans += n & 1;
                len++;
                n >>= 1;
            }
            max_len = max(max_len, len);
        }
        
        return ans + max_len - 1;
    }
};
```
