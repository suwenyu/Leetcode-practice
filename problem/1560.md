## 1560. Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track

Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. The ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]

Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).

### Example
Example 1
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/14/tmp.jpg "img")
```
Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.
```

Example 2
```
Input: n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
Output: [2]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 7, rounds = [1,3,5,7]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

### Code
1. Method 1
Intuitive Idea

Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Space Complexity: O(N)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& rounds) {
        for(auto& r : rounds)
            r -= 1;
        
        int len = rounds.size();
        vector<int> count(n, 0);
        vector<int> ans;
        for(int i = 1 ; i < rounds.size() ; i++){

            int tmp;
            if(rounds[i] < rounds[i-1])
                tmp = rounds[i] + n;
            else
                tmp = rounds[i];
  
            for(int j = rounds[i-1] ; j < tmp ; j++){
                count[j % n]++;
            }
        }
        
        count[rounds[len-1]]++;
        int max_val = 0;
        
        auto it = max_element(begin(count), end(count));
        for(int i = 0 ; i < count.size() ; i++)
            if(count[i] == *it)
                ans.push_back(i+1);
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

2. Method 2

Explanation
If start <= end, return the range [start, end].
If end < start, return the range [1, end] + range [start, n].

Complexity
Time O(N)
Space O(N)

```c++
vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& A) {
    vector<int> res;
    for (int i = A[0]; i <= A[A.size() - 1]; ++i)
        res.push_back(i);
    if (res.size() > 0) return res;
    for (int i = 1; i <= A[A.size() - 1]; ++i)
        res.push_back(i);
    for (int i = A[0]; i <= n; ++i)
        res.push_back(i);
    return res;
}
```
