## 683. K Empty Slots

You have N bulbs in a row numbered from 1 to N. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off. We turn on exactly one bulb everyday until all bulbs are on after N days.

You are given an array bulbs of length N where bulbs[i] = x means that on the (i+1)th day, we will turn on the bulb at position x where i is 0-indexed and x is 1-indexed.

Given an integer K, find out the minimum day number such that there exists two turned on bulbs that have exactly K bulbs between them that are all turned off.

If there isn't such day, return -1.



### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: 
bulbs: [1,3,2]
K: 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the first day: bulbs[0] = 1, first bulb is turned on: [1,0,0]
On the second day: bulbs[1] = 3, third bulb is turned on: [1,0,1]
On the third day: bulbs[2] = 2, second bulb is turned on: [1,1,1]
We return 2 because on the second day, there were two on bulbs with one off bulb between them.


Example 2:

Input: 
bulbs: [1,2,3]
K: 1
Output: -1
```

### My Code
```c++
```

### Others Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int kEmptySlots(vector<int>& bulbs, int K) {
        vector<int> days(bulbs.size());
        for(int i = 0; i < bulbs.size(); i++)
            days[bulbs[i]-1] = i+1;
        
        int left = 0, right = K + 1, res = INT_MAX;
        for(int i = 0 ; right < days.size(); i++){
            if(days[i] < days[left] || days[i] <= days[right]){
                // cout << days[i] << " " << days[left] << " " << days[right] << endl;
                if(i == right)
                    res = min(res, max(days[left], days[right]));
                left = i, right = K+1+i;
            }
        }
        if(res == INT_MAX)
            return -1;
        
        return res;
        
    }
};

先記錄所有燈會在第幾天打開，
然後再跑一個loop檢查
