## 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.


Example 2:

Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        vector<int> tmp;
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < A.size() ; i++){
            count++;
            if(i+1 == A.size() || A[i] != A[i+1]){
                if(A[i] == 0)
                    tmp.push_back(-count);
                else
                    tmp.push_back(count);
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        for(auto i : tmp)
            cout << i << " ";
        cout << endl;
        
        
        
        return 0;
    }
};
```
wrong answer...


### Others Solution
```c++
int longestOnes(vector<int>& A, int K) {
    int i = 0, j;
    for (j = 0; j < A.size(); ++j) {
        if (A[j] == 0) K--;
        if (K < 0 && A[i++] == 0) K++;
    }
    return j - i;
}
```
sliding window:

Explanation
For each A[j], try to find the longest subarray.
If A[i] ~ A[j] has zeros <= K, we continue to increment j.
If A[i] ~ A[j] has zeros > K, we increment i.
