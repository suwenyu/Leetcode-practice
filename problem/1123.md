## 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

* The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
* The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d+1.
* The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.

### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: 
The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization "[1,2,3]".


Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [4]


Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [2,4,5]
```

### My Code
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    pair<TreeNode*, int>helper(TreeNode* root){
        if(root){
            auto left = helper(root->left);
            auto right = helper(root->right);
            if(left.second > right.second)
                return {left.first, left.second + 1};
            if(right.second > left.second)
                return {right.first, right.second + 1};
            return {root, left.second+1};
            
        }
        else
            return {NULL, 0};
    }

    TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        auto ans = helper(root);
        return ans.first;
    }
};
```
