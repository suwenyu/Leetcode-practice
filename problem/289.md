## 289. Game of Life

According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.


### Example
```
Example:

Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

Follow up:

1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

### My Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        if(board.size() == 0)
            return;
        
        const vector<vector<int>> dirs = {{1,-1},{1,0},{1,1},{0,-1},{0,1},{-1,-1},{-1,0},{-1,1}};
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < m ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < n ; j++){
                int count = 0;
                

                for(auto d : dirs){
                    int x = d[0] + i;
                    int y = d[1] + j;
                    if(x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n)
                        continue;
                    if(board[x][y] & 1)
                        count++;
                }
                
                if(board[i][j] == 0){
                    if(count == 3)
                        board[i][j] = 2;
                }
                else{
                    if(count < 2 || count > 3)
                        board[i][j] = 1;
                    else
                        board[i][j] = 3;
                }
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < m ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < n ; j++){
                board[i][j] >>= 1;
            }
        }
        
    }
};
```
time complexity : O(MN)
space complexity : O(1)

最基本的想法就是new新的array來儲存下一個狀態變化，
follow up希望把空間複雜度壓在O(1) 
->
把現在live 未來還會live的存成 3，
把現在dead 未來會live的存成 2
把現在live 未來會dead的存成 1
-> 
判斷的時候先判斷 board(i, j) % 2 == 0 
最後再把整個board/2 就能得到最後會活著的
