## 911. Online Election

In an election, the i-th vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i].

Now, we would like to implement the following query function: TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time t.  

Votes cast at time t will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.


### Example
```
Example 1:

Input: ["TopVotedCandidate","q","q","q","q","q","q"], [[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,0,0,1]
Explanation: 
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8.
```

### My Code
```c++
class TopVotedCandidate {
    vector<int> times;
    unordered_map<int, int>m;
public:
    TopVotedCandidate(vector<int>& persons, vector<int>& times) {
        int n = persons.size(), lead = 0;
        this->times = times;
        unordered_map<int, int>mp;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < times.size() ; i++){
            mp[persons[i]]++;
            if(mp[persons[i]] >= mp[lead])
                lead = persons[i];
            m[times[i]] = lead;
        }
        // for(auto i : m)
        //     cout << i.first << " " << i.second << endl; 
    }
    
    int q(int t) {
        auto pos = *--upper_bound(times.begin(), times.end(), t);
        return m[pos];
    }
};

/**
 * Your TopVotedCandidate object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TopVotedCandidate* obj = new TopVotedCandidate(persons, times);
 * int param_1 = obj->q(t);
 */
```
先用一個map紀錄現在當前的lead
再用全局的map紀錄特定時間的lead
