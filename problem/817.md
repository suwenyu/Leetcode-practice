## 817. Linked List Components

We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.

We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

### Example
```
Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.


Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3->4
G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
```

### Other Solutions
```python

class Solution(object):
    def numComponents(self, head, G):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type G: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        setG = set(G)
        res = 0
        while head:
            if head.val in setG and (head.next == None or head.next.val not in setG):
                res+=1
            head = head.next
        print res
        return res
```
