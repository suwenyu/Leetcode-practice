## 1979. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array

Given an integer array nums, return the greatest common divisor of the smallest number and largest number in nums.

The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

### Example

Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
```

Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
```

Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 3.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
```

### Code

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int gcd(int a, int b)
    {
        // Everything divides 0
        if (a == 0)
           return b;
        if (b == 0)
           return a;

        // base case
        if (a == b)
            return a;

        // a is greater
        if (a > b)
            return gcd(a-b, b);
        return gcd(a, b-a);
    }
    
    int findGCD(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_val = 0, min_val = INT_MAX;
        for(auto n : nums){
            max_val = max(max_val, n);
            min_val = min(min_val, n);
        }
        
        return gcd(max_val, min_val);
    }
};
```
